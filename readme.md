# ECMAC: AoT Compiler for ECMAScript

**ecmac** (ECMAScript to C) seeks to implement an Ahead-of-Time (AoT) Compiler targeting ECMAScript, starting with ES5,
to produce native executables using Clang.

## Overview

This project focuses on transforming ECMAScript code into C, leveraging Clang for compilation into native executables.

The goal is to support various ECMAScript standards, beginning with ES5.

## Key Features

- **AoT Compilation**: Converts ECMAScript directly to C.
- **Native Executables**: Generates platform-specific binaries using Clang.
- **Incremental Standard Adoption**: Starting with ES5, plans to support newer ECMAScript versions progressively.

## Roadmap

### Version 1.0

- [ ] Implement AoT Compiler for ECMAScript 5.1 (ES5.1).
- [ ] Generate equivalent C code for ES5.1 constructs.
- [ ] Integrate Clang for compiling C code to native executables.
- [ ] Basic error handling and diagnostics.

### Future Versions

Each future version will extend support for additional ECMAScript standards and optimize existing features.
